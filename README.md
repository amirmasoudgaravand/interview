In this challenge code, I used react, redux toolkit, typescript and used sass for style, I did not use any library for form validations and I wrote functions for them myself for two reasons: 1. Because the number of inputs It is little and there is no need to burden the project. 2. To be able to show my abilities better.In this project, we tried to write a suitable and understandable structure
